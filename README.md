# FlowFocus
# FlowFocus is a program designed to keep a healthy and safe menstrual cycle for everyone. Our users will create reports that as of right now will include blood flow, colors, moods, and symptoms. We will then analyze the reports, and then provide recommended actions for our users to take. This can help put users at ease if they don't necessarily know certain details about their menstrual cycle. It can also help users know when to see a healthcare provider if needed.

# Instruction
# When running the program you are brought to the initial screen. You can choose to sign up or log in. However if you don't have an account, you cannot log in so please sign up!
# When you make an account, you can then log in. If you already have an account, you can log in and you are then brought to the Home/Main Page. From here you can choose to create a report, view past reports, or view the calendar.
# When making a report, you can choose your Blood flow, what color it is, moods you have been feeling as well as symptoms. After choosing your options and hitting the continue button, this will bring you to the summary page. It will summarize your answers, as well as providing you with recommendations for each option you picked. This will tell you more information about your menstrual cycle.
# When going to the view report page, you can see your past reports. These will be displayed as Report_'date'.txt for example - Report_12-03-24.txt
# Just click and you are navigated to your report!
# When going to the calendar page, here you will see a working calendar. Unfortunately it is just a working calendar with no real function besides showing you the day, month and year.
# Navigation is easy with buttons that take you from screen to screen, as well as a menu in the top corner that can take you from screen to screen.
# When you're done, feel free to log out, or close out which will automatically log out for you.
